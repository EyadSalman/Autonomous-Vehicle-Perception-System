# ðŸš— Autonomous Vehicle Perception System

An end-to-end Perception System that analyzes driving scenes from both images and videos.  
Integrates multiple Computer Vision models to perform **Object Detection**, **Road/Lane Segmentation**, and **Depth Estimation**.  
Supports real-world dashcam datasets as well as videos captured around vehicles.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Unified Perception Pipeline handling both images and videos.
- Supports YOLOv8 Object Detection + Segmentation + MiDaS Depth Estimation.
- Preprocessing and Cleaning of datasets (removing corrupt/broken files).
- Video frame extraction for unified frame-based processing.
- Visualization of detection, segmentation, and depth side-by-side.
- Modular design â†’ Easily extensible for new perception tasks.
